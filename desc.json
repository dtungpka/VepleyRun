  "Guide": "Welcome to the VepleyAI project! We are thrilled to have you on board as a training data provider.\nYour contribution will play a crucial role in helping us create an advanced machine learning model\nthat can revolutionize the industry. Your task will be to provide accurate and high-quality training\ndata that will be used to train the model. With your help, we are confident that the model will perform\nat its best and bring great value to our users. Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey, and\nwe look forward to a productive and successful collaboration!\nAs a person providing training data for the VepleyAI project, your task is to stand in front of the camera\nand perform 5 different hand actions. To ensure high-quality training data, please follow these instructions:\nStand in a well-lit area with a clear view of your hands.\nMove your hand in a slow and controlled manner, avoiding sudden or jerky movements.\nHold your hand still when the progress bar moves up. When you see \"Continue in **\" on\nthe screen, move your hand to a different position each time to provide a diverse range of examples.\nThe 5 hand actions you will perform are:\n(1) Idle\n(2) Pickup_item\n(3) Use_item\n(4) Aim\n(5) Shoot\nBetween each action, there will be a detailed instruction for each one.\nMake sure your hand is fully visible in each frame, without any objects obstructing the view.\nIf possible, try to perform the actions against a plain background to make it easier for the model\nto identify your hand movements.\nBy following these guidelines, you can help ensure that the VepleyAI project receives high-quality training data, which will be used to train a machine learning model to recognize and categorize hand movements. Thank you for your contribution!",
